1. Install psycopg2 

On windows use binary downloaded from http://www.stickpeople.com/projects/python/win-psycopg/ or http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/. Do pip install psycopg2-2.6.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl (or whatever). 

On linux i think you can just do the usual sudo apt-get install python-pscopg2

2. Then do pip install requirements.txt

3. Make sure postgres and postgis are both installed. Create your database, eia_tool. Then do CREATE EXTENSION postgis; for that db

4. You need to install GDAL as we are using json 'Initializing geometry from JSON input requires GDAL.'.

On linux $ sudo apt-get install binutils libproj-dev gdal-bin

On windows, get the gdal binary from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ and pip install it again.
